# Confluence Vote Table

This confluence app allows you to add ranking tables to any confluence page.

## Motivation
My main use case is the planning and operation of monthly discussion sessions.
The idea is, that users can add topic suggestions and vote on those topics, whereas the topic with the most topics gets discussed every month.
Unfortunately, I couldn't find any free app that provides this feature for Confluence.

## Installation
See [ranking-table/README.md](/ranking-table/README.md) for installation instructions.

## Usage
Just type `/ranking-table` when editing a Confluence page to create a ranking table.
Once the ranking table is created, users can add topics, and vote on them.
Topics are sorted by votes.
The creator of a topic can also delete the topic at any time.

## Disclaimer
The current source code is a very early, potentially hacky, version - use at your own risk.

I'm neither a JavaScript developer nor a Confluence app developer - the code quality might be bad.
